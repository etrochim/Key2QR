It will make a png of 4xn QR codes, depending on the key size

Requires:
    - gpg
        Obviously, to read the keys
    - qrencode
        To convert into the qr code images. available in AUR
    - split
        For splitting up the keyfile into qrencodable chunks
    - shred
        Not strictly necessary, can be replaced with rm, but i'd rather not have my private key lying around
    - vips
        For joining the images together, avalable in AUR
    - convert
        From imagemagick, for manipulation of images
